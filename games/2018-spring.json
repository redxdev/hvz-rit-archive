The Moridarty gang, founded by its namesake of mathematical fame, has maintained control of London&#39;s criminal organizations for nearly a decade. The results of their crimes are evident, yet the hands which weave those delicate webs have been nigh untraceable. Jones, true to his iron will, has persisted upon Moridarty&#39;s track and is even now constructing the evidence necessary for the common Englishman&#39;s jury. Unfortunately, the gang appears to have a multitude of trickery prepared for their final days. A wave of unprecedented violence has drowned the city; Smashed statuettes.&nbsp;Blackmails. Cannibalistic hysteria. Due to the very real and ever present threat, Scotland yard has made recent use of a private firm to assist in guarding the populace. This firm has become the frontline against Moridarty&#39;s outrage, but if Sherlock Jones&#39; words are to be trusted, the gang&#39;s rampage is almost at an end. But until then, the firm must continue to stand tall against the tides of madness...</p>\n"
